# Polynomial_Regression
Polynomial regression can be a suitable method for modeling a dependent variable that exhibits nonlinear relationships with one or more independent variables. It extends the linear regression model by including polynomial terms of the independent variables, allowing the model to fit more complex, curved relationships.

For solving this kind of problem you have to follow these steps
* Import all the necessary liberaries like matplotlib,pandas,numpy etc.
* Import the dataset
* Train the dataset using Polynomial regression method
* Now visualise the Polynomial Regression it means use matplot lib and plot a graph for ease
* Now predict by giving different inputs based on your needs.
